# project-euler
Project Euler is a site that contains a set of math-focused questions that can be solved with code. I have used multiples languages to solve these problems, including Java, Python, and Scala. These questions can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/

For Java solutions, change the Main class name to the name corresponding with the Java file to compile and run.
